# Networks Days: a collaborative platform for advancing network science

## Manifesto

*Do you feel there are plenty of opportunities for large, global events, but not enough small, local workshops dedicated to complex networks? Then you might want to organize your own local Networks Days!*

"Networks Days" is a delocalized scientific workshop aimed at bringing together researchers, students, and professionals in the field of network science. The aim of these events is to foster open discussions about the latest advances and future directions of network research, with a strong focus on collective knowledge-building in an informal, yet academically rigorous, environment.

"Networks Days" promotes small-scale, interactive gatherings where every participant contributes to and benefits from in-depth exchanges of ideas. Anyone can organize a "Networks Days" event: the only requirement is to keep the minimum required format and gather the materials for this repository.

## Key Features

- **Small, focused groups**: often "less is more". There are many venues for large meetings, in "Networks Days" the participation should be limited to 20-30 individuals to ensure that all attendees engage in meaningful discussions, fostering a close-knit environment for collaboration.
  
- **Autonomy in organization**: each "Networks Days" event is independently organized, but they all share a common goal of advancing network science and contributing to a collective knowledge repository. Workshops will be named `Networks Days - City MM/YYYY` to reflect their location and date.

- **International accessibility**: the entire workshop will be held in English to accommodate international participants and ensure that shared materials are accessible to a global audience. Each event will have its own repository named following the format `YYYY-MM-City`.

- **Flexible format**: the workshop is designed to unfold over a whole day. As a general recommendation, consider to include a night between two consecutive sessions: this is expected to promote more informal interaction and enhance collaboration. At least one session should be fully open to local students and network enthusiasts. 

- **Closed-door session**: a part of the workshop might be reserved for invited speakers to engage in closed-door discussions focused on potential collaborations and research synergies. This private session is essential for generating practical ideas for future work.


## Building collective knowledge

This is a very important aspect. All materials from "Networks Days" events, such as presentations, collaborative notes, and other resources, will be shared this repository. This ensures that the outcomes of each event are accessible to the broader scientific community and contribute to the collective advancement of knowledge in network science.

Anyone can organize their own "Networks Days" events, provided they adhere to the core principles of the workshop: maintaining small, interactive gatherings and contributing to the shared repository of materials. 

There should be no participation fees, and events are encouraged to seek local funding or small sponsors to support their organization. This open, decentralized model allows for sustainable growth while ensuring that the focus remains on quality discussions and meaningful collaborations.
